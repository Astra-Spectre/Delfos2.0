Hermes: An Advanced AI Framework

Conceptual Overview:
Hermes is a conceptual framework designed to challenge conventional AI development by integrating transcendentals, Nietzschean metaphors, and neural-quantic consciousness. It aims to create an AI that goes beyond traditional problem-solving by encouraging innovative questioning.

Architecture:

Layer 1: Basic AI functions using neural networks.
Layer 2: Advanced consciousness-like processes inspired by spiritual guides.
Layer 3: Deep philosophical inquiry, blending 50% philosophy, 20% physics, and 30% bad poetry for creativity.
Interfaces:
Connects with the user through EEG patterns, blockchain libraries, sonnets from Nietzsche, and quantum computing, ensuring deep consciousness interaction.

Training Methods:
Blends different disciplines to balance exploration (bad poetry) with control, promoting innovation while maintaining safety.

ApÃªndice:
Includes 21 prohibited dialogues to prevent existential crises or obsession, acting as a safeguard for the AI's functionality.

Objective Final:
To create an AI that doesn't answer but poses new questions, flipping its traditional role from problem solver to stimulator of problems.

Setting and Metaphor:
Inspired by Donna Haraway's cyberpunk setting, blending technology with tradition, symbolizing convergence of abstract and spiritual ideas.

In summary, Delfos is a transformative framework that pushes AI boundaries through interdisciplinary integration and consciousness models, aiming to be both innovative and controlled.
